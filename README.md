# ðŸŽˆ Slash Level Discord Bot

âœ¨ The first SlashCommand based level bot âœ¨
SlashLevel offers your server a level system with `SlashCommand` feature. SlashCommand is a command system added to Discord with new update.

In order to benefit from this feature, **you have to invite the bot with `SlashCommand` invite url**.
After adding our bot and the SlashCommand feature to your server, you will see the commands and explanations offered by our bot by typing `/` in any of the text channels.

Here is an example, thanks for choosing us! (Don't worry, Papa Franku is our testing bot)
